    "Hi ðŸ‘‹,\n",
    "I'm David Kunz, an architect for the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and in this course, you will learn some of the prompt-engineering techniques I created in the development of [capGPT](https://github.tools.sap/cap/AI/tree/main/cds-gen), a CLI tool to generate apps for the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/).\n",

    "\n",
    "To get an understanding of the basic building blocks of CAP, please read the [Getting Started Guide](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell).\n",
    "It's not mandatory for this session, but it's helpful to know the overall context.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR:\n",
    "- [CAP](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) is a framework to build cloud-native apps on BTP.\n",
    "- It comes with a declarative language to model your domain entities, example CDS file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```cds\n",
    "    entity Book {\n",
    "        key ID: UUID;\n",
    "        title: String;\n",
    "        author: Association to Author;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    entity Author {\n",
    "        key ID: UUID;\n",
    "        firstName: String;\n",
    "        lastName: String\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    service Bookshop {\n",
    "        entity Books as projection on Book;\n",
    "        entity Authors as projection on Author;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- You can provide test data in form of CSV files, example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```csv\n",
    "    ID;title;author_ID\n",
    "    fc61e102-f0e2-47b8-9853-ed007dcd52e7;The Great Gatsby;4a3cf450-3512-4efd-afb9-2567e140d251\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- With these building blocks you already have a working [OData](https://www.odata.org/) service.\n",
    "- You can enrich your CDS model with UI annotations and add a [Fiori Elements](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/smart-templates/) UI on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## capGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "On November 30th, 2022, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) was released and a few days later I noticed that it could even generate CAP models, [see my corresponding blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/12/08/having-fun-with-sap-cap-and-chatgpt/).\n",
    "A few months later, on a Friday evening, I built the initial version of [capGPT](https://github.tools.sap/cap/AI/tree/main/cds-gen) which I refined in the following months. The plan is to ship it to external customers for TechEd 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generate CDS data models and test data just by providing a textual description, giving you a head start into CAP development.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "capGPT \"Build an app with authors and books. An author has a first name and a last name. A book has a title and an author.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will automatically generate all needed CDS files and test data for a working server, including a Fiori Elements preview on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agenda\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, I will give you a step-by-step overview on how to design the prompts, overcome the obstacles and make it as efficient as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All code snippets are written in Python, but you can use any programming language since you effectively just need to send HTTP requests. `capGPT` itself is a Node.js application."
